# Transporter for iOS

![](http://blog.phillipcaudell.com/content/images/2015/02/Artboard-2.jpg)

For those out there who use public transportation, you've at some point experienced the pain of answering the simple question of:

> "When's the next bus?" 

There are apps out there at the moment that help with this,  but they all have one fatal flaw: they make you choose a bus stop first. 

This may seem like a trivial detail, but if you're in a town centre with 20 stops nearby, and you're unsure which one your bus calls at, you have to resort to pecking around the map loading up each stops departures. *It's less than ideal*.

## Enter Transporter

Transporter works differently. It uses your current location to return bus *routes*, not stops. This means you can open it up and immediately get a list of departures from your location, regardless of the stop it's at. No need to hunt around for the stop. No tapping to select things. Just departures.
